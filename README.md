ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all requirements for this task, as well as a few stretch goals.

I have added the option for users to edit their username and bio, and edit or delete any posts they previously made.

On the timeline page users can also access other users profiles by clicking the link in their posts.

When users initially log in, a form is shown to prompt them to finish their profile information, which will have seed information in it until they do.

I've also added small customisations for the user for example, when viewing their own profile it will say 'Your Profile', whereas on another users page it will display their nickname at the top of the page, along with the users profile picture which is linked to clerk.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I would have liked to add the ability for users to like posts in their timeline, however I ran out of time.
When i continue with this project in my own time, I will also change the timeline layout so that the 'new post' form is a modal accesible via a button click.

One of my other goals was to add a custom Bee cursor for the page, but I couldn't get it to display.

I'd also like to fine tune the styling of the page as it feels a bit basic at the moment.
